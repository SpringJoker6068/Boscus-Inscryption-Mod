Alright, so. I'll be putting some concepts here so that I can keep track of them better.
But you could also read the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRV2nu_d4K7OxY2v_Ehe_9c49MUGM4G4dRM4ykaeZBk/edit?usp=sharing) which will be far more detailed but also contain spoilers for the lore and mod.
Though I guess this document will also have that :P
